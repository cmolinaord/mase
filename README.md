# MASE (ESEIAAT)
Scripts and applications developed during my Master's Degree in Space and Aeronautical Engineering at ESEIAAT-UPC (Terrassa)

## Computational Engineering
This course has the purpouse of forming the students in the computational methods used in Aerospace Engineering to solve problems
related with Fluid Dynamics, Heat & Mass tranfer and Structural Stress.

## Aerospace Laboratories
This subject consist in a series o experimental sessions about aerospace topics. In particular, the practices will be the next:

#### 1. Drone flight
Recording GPS and sensors data form a flying unmanned plane
The code for this task could be written using the languaje we like the most, for example Matlab, C, Python... I'm using the
last one. The code must be able of parsing the data recorded by the BIMUG (**B**arometer **I**nertial **M**essurement **U**nit **G** PS)
system installed on the drone, and then syncronize this data with a video recorded with a camera also installed on the plane.

#### 2. Turbojet engine
Test and meassure parameters of a turbojet engine
#### 3. Flight simulator
Perform measurements during a flight simulation
#### 4. Launch a rocket
Prepare and launch a small rocket

## My stuff
This library is for my own scripts, that could be very related to
the ones done within the courses but they are completly apart from them, and usually tend to be more interesting indeed.
