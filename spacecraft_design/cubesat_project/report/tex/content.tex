\subsection{Communications}
Due to the fact that the main objective of the mission is to provide internet
communications along the globe, this subsystem is considered critical for the
mission success. The communications subsystem (COMMS) will be the one in charge
of providing effective transmission and reception of the radio signals between the
satellite and both the ground stations and other satellites, within \MissionName
constellation or third part satellites.
