\section{Introduction}

\MissionName is a CubeSat proposed mission that aims to deploy a network of small,
low-cost nanosatellites in orbits around the whole Earth in order to provide
citizens with an accessible, reliable Internet of Things, so they and their devices,
like, for example, intelligent cars, home appliances, shops, offices and homes, can
connect each other to interact and send information, make monetary transactions or
have remote control on the "Things" you may want to command.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is new emerging technology that is still open to many
possibilities and development. IoT is said to born during the beginnings of 2010 decade,
and it could have many applications in fields as different as consumer focus technologies
as smart home or elder care, or more commercial applications related with healthcare 
(remote medical assistance, medical monitoring), transportation (smart traffic control,
emerging intelligent self-driven cars), building and home automation tasks for both
public, private or industrial applications; and also industrial applications like
manufacturing, with emerging big data technologies or by controlling supply chain
networks with a large number of distributed sensors; agriculture control or environmental
monitoring.

Companies and people are just starting to benefit from this emerging technology,
but the future possibilities are wide open, and there are many start-ups
entering to the market in the last few years. Our intent with this project is
to provide this technology from space, wherever you are in the planet, 24/7, with
the low-cost alternative of CubeSats, instead of heavier and more expensive
traditional satellites.
