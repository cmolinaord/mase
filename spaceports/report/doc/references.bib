abstract = {A launching pad, because of its activity, is particularly sensitive to the risk of lightning. The use of Standard IEC62305 "Protection against lightning" establishes the general framework for the Lightning Protection System (LPS). However, the specific activity of a launching pad requires special analysis on specific points of the LPS. Indeed, it is necessary to take into account the lightning conductor system particularity on the one hand, and the launcher electromagnetic susceptibility on the other hand. This paper presents the general methodology used to define the LPS of a launching pad. The analysis is based upon expertise, numerical simulation and experiments performed at launching pad sites.},
