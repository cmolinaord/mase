\section{Introduction}
The main idea of this study is to account for some systems involved in the
protection and integrity of the rocket in the phases previous to launch and
also during the first seconds of the launch, when the rocket is still close
to the ground. Two main topics will be studied. The protection against lightnings
before and during launch, and the acoustic protection during launch created by the
vibrations generated by the rocket engines.

The first topic is related with the active protection of the launch pad area against
lightning that could hit on launch pad facilities or onto the rocket during the days
or hours before the launch, and could potentially damage some systems or even create
an explosion or fire on the rocket. To prevent this, one of the security measures
taken is the build of one or more towers finished in an electrical conductor that
could prevent the rays to hit the facilities and also helps to deionize the air,
making it less likely to allow lightenings.

The second topic is also related with the security of the rocket but it applies
only during launching initial period. As itâ€™s knows, the rocket engine generate
huge amount of noise and vibrations that would propagate through the air in all
directions, but also to the ground and possible walls, or structures around the
launch pad. The reflection of that powerful sound waves may amplify and resonate
inside the launch pad and could come back to the rocket and other launch pad
systems causing strong damage to them.

In order to mitigate this effects and reduce the amplitude of that waves, some
systems has been proposed. One of them is the use of a large mass of water that
would damp the vibrations. The main problem of that is the generation of that
huge amount of water in the short period of launches. [1]

The water would also help to reduce the heat generated by the exhaust gases of
the rocket engine that are conducted to the flame deflectors. In the case of
Launch Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, a tank of 300,000 gallons of
water is emptied in 41 seconds from 16 nozzles on top of the launch pad, and
it starts 7 seconds before the ignition of liftoff.
