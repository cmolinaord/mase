abstract = {Resumen En este trabajo se estudia el desarrollo de materiales compuestos de matriz polim{\'{e}}rica reforzados con fibras de carbono para aplicaciones que presentan solicitaciones severas. Este es el caso de la industria aeroespacial, que utiliza componentes en cohetes y aeronaves que se ven sometidos a altas solicitaciones mec{\'{a}}nicas y est{\'{a}}n expuestos a las altas temperaturas. Es por ello que se estudiaron materiales para diversas aplicaciones basados en fibras de carbono: preim-pregnados de fibras y resina fen{\'{o}}lica resistentes a altas temperaturas y laminados para procesar compuestos por t{\'{e}}cnicas de infusi{\'{o}}n. En el primer caso se efectu{\'{o}} el desarrollo completo de los materiales compuestos, partiendo de la s{\'{i}}ntesis de la resina, el procesamiento y caracterizaci{\'{o}}n de los preimpregnados, la fabricaci{\'{o}}n de placas de material compuesto y su caracterizaci{\'{o}}n en t{\'{e}}rminos de resistencia mec{\'{a}}nica y al fuego. Se efectuaron ensayos en un calor{\'{i}}metro de cono, que permite determinar la velocidad de liberaci{\'{o}}n de calor durante el proceso de combusti{\'{o}}n y analizar la emi-si{\'{o}}n de vol{\'{a}}tiles a lo largo del proceso. En relaci{\'{o}}n a los laminados para procesar compuestos por t{\'{e}}cnicas de infusi{\'{o}}n, se caracteriz{\'{o}} un par{\'{a}}metro de vital importancia que determina la facilidad de la resina para impregnar el refuerzo durante el llenado de moldes: la permeabilidad del tejido de fibras de carbono. Este par{\'{a}}metro se caracteriz{\'{o}} en diversas direcciones del tejido, a fin de obtener el denominado tensor de permeabilidad, que permite predecir los tiempos de infusi{\'{o}}n y patrones de flojo, minimizando el contenido de poros en el material final a trav{\'{e}}s del control de la velocidad de avance de la resina en el molde. Palabras clave: materiales compuestos, alta prestaci{\'{o}}n, fibras de carbono, preimpregnados, resistencia al fuego, permeabilidad Abstract Development of advanced composite materials based on carbon fibers for the aerospace industry. This work is focused on the development of carbon reinforced polymer matrix composite materials for high performance applications. Such applications are common in the aerospace industry, which uses components that are subjected to high mechanical stresses and work under high service temperatures. Taking into account this strategic industrial sector, materials for different applications were studied: high temperature carbon fabric/phenolic resin prepregs and carbon fabrics for infusion techniques. In the first case, composites materials were developed starting from the synthesis of the phenolic resin, the processing carbon/phenolic prepregs and the obtaining of composite plaques that were characterized in terms of mechanical properties and fire resistance. A cone calorimeter was used to study the fire behavior of the composites, obtaining the heat release rate evolution and the CO and smoke emission during the combustion process. In the second study, carbon fabrics were characterized in terms of a very important parameter that determines the impregnation mechanisms in infusion processes: the reinforcement permeability. This parameter was characterized for different directions of the fabric in order to obtain a ten-sor that allows predicting filling times and a flow patterns, minimizing void content in the final composites by controlling resin flow front velocity in the mold.},

abstract = {In this paper, the influence of prepreg material quality to the mechanical properties of CFRP parts is presented. During the out life of prepreg slit tape, the processability changes by aging especially when storing the material at room temperature. Therefore, investigations are done with an in-house developed AFP machine and are monitored with a thermal monitoring system to determine the influence of material aging to mechanical properties and changes in the manufacturing process. The manufactured CFRP plates are finally tested by 3-point bending test.},

abstract = {Abrasive Water Jet (AWJ) technology has demonstrated to be an interesting manufacturing process for space, aircraft, boat and automotive sectors due to its specific advantages when machining composite materials. However, AWJ cutting of composite laminates possesses several challenges. It is necessary to develop a methodology to adapt the process parameters for each type of FRP {\&} CFRP material which will allow AWJ trimming operations to be easily carried out on composite materials, since machine manufacturers still do not provide good databases for composite cutting. The presented work aims at studying the behaviour of a machinability model in composite materials. The machinability index for various composite materials with different thicknesses was found experimentally, which showed very different results for different materials. A study of the effect of the abrasive waterjet process parameters on the quality of cut (taper and surface roughness) was carried out.},

abstract = {The demand for fuel efficient aircraft led to the development of innovative lightweight constructions and the use of lightweight materials, such as carbon fibre reinforced plastics. In the same manner competences in new production technologies have been built up in the aerospace industry. However, current processes for producing lightweight composites with an excellent mechanical performance cause high costs and long process cycles in comparison with approved metal processes. Furthermore the used raw materials, such as carbon fibres and resin, are very expensive. In contrast to these technologies Sheet Moulding Compound is characterised by a very high productivity, excellent part reproducibility, cost efficiency and the possibility to realise parts with complex geometries and integrated functions, e.g. inserts or colouring. The biggest disadvantage of Sheet Moulding Compound parts is a low level of stiffness and strength because of a low fibre-volume fraction, a short fibre length and isotropic fibre distribution. In this context the combination of Sheet Moulding Compound and Prepreg compression moulding in an one-shot compression moulding and curing process merges the advantages of both materials to create load-bearing and autoclave-quality parts without an autoclave. In the following article, this new technology and its potential will be presented. This paper will also deal with the resulting material characteristics.},

abstract = {In aeronautical production, autoclave curing of composite parts must be performed according to a specified diagram of temperature and pressure vs time. Part-tool assembly thermal inertia and shape have a large influence on the heating and cooling rate, and therefore on the dwell time within the target temperature range. When simultaneously curing diverse composite parts, the total autoclave cycle time is driven by the part-tool assembly with the lower heating and cooling rates. With the aim to minimize the autoclave cycle time and energy consumption improving the manufacturing system resource efficiency, a new parameter was defined to characterize the part-tool assembly thermal and geometric properties. This parameter was applied to determine the optimal positioning of the parts on the autoclave charge floor.},

abstract = {This chapter is concerned with the application of infrared thermography to investigate composite materials, which are used for the fabrication of aerospace components, and is organized into several sections. In particular, it starts with a brief introduction to composite materials, discussing also their main weaknesses. Then, an overview on the most used methods of nondestructive evaluation is given, highlighting some crucial aspects. The core of the chapter regards the description of the basics of infrared thermography, and the advantages of introducing it in an industrial enterprise; some key examples concerning on-line monitoring of loading tests and nondestructive evaluation of either final parts, or impact damaged parts, are also illustrated. In addition, some critical features, such as noise effects, are addressed with a proposed likely solution. The most important emphasized result regards the possibility to monitor impact tests with an infrared imaging device to get information about initiation and damage propagation directly on-line during the impact event, as well as damage extension evaluation through subsequent postprocessing of the acquired thermal images.},
